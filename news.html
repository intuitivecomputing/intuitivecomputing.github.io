          <h3>Support for and progress on social navigation research</h3>
          <p>Our work on intent aware robot navigation has recently led to a conference paper (ICRA'20) and a seed fund from the <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/iaa/" id="news">JHU Institute for Assured Autonomy</a>. We are excited to continue this line of work to investigate how to seamlessly integrate mobile robotic assistance into human environments.</p>

          <h3>Papers to appear at HRI'20</h3>
          <p> We have a full paper and a late-breaking report accepted to <a href="https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2020/" id="news">HRI’20</a>.<br><br>

            Full paper -- “See What I See: Enabling User-Centric Robotic Assistance Using First-Person Demonstrations” is
             led by Yeping Wang and Gopika Ajaykumar, and describes a new way of robot programming by first-person demonstrations and its effects on human-robot collaboration. <br><br>

             Late-breaking report -- "User Needs and Design Opportunities in End-User Robot Programming" by Gopika Ajaykumar describes limitations in a state-of-the-art robot programming interface and their implications for new interface design.
